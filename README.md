# Nylenda B Waste Processing Optimization

# Introduction #
This project aims to optimize the circulation of Kontiki kilns throughout the Nylenda B area in Kenya to enable efficient pyrolysis of human waste, providing the community with a cleaner, less polluting waste processing method.

# Project Objective #
Develop an automated system to identify optimal routes for kiln circulation to maximize coverage and accessibility for the local population, with the aid of image recognition and geospatial analysis.

# Installation #

# Repository Structure #
Explanation of the scripts included in the repository and their roles:

- `green.py`: Identifies green locations on satellite maps.
- `countGreen.py`: Counts green dots and extracts coordinates.
- `countHousehold.py`: Identifies household locations from dotted maps.
- `countBlue.py`: Counts blue dots representing road locations.
- `shedLocation.py`: Algorithm for assigning households to nearest kiln location.

# Usage #
How to run the scripts and examples of output data.
